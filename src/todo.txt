remove tags?
1. Get the whole gallery and render it all in order to make the UI Grid.
2. add pagination. (1, 2, inputfield, 3, 4, 750 (last))
3. Add inclusive tags filter
4. Add exclusive tag filter

When we upload an image, check the hash of the image if it already exists (id in content table)
if it exists, go to edit preview instead of add new image..
Make a wrapper that will do that because of how hook forms default values work.

Dashboard Grid images, right click with options to:
edit image
copy image path
copy image (sharing)
copy image url (sharing)(if it exists)


When open Image top right icon button for going directly into edit mode.

User default options: (preferences)
sfw / nsfw switch
